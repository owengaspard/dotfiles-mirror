# Owen Gaspard's Dotfiles

My dotfiles for various programs I use in Linux.  Some are based off others' work.  Proper credit is given if that is the case.

## THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED

## What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles get the name from the hidden config folder.  In *NIX operating systems, directories and files can be hidden by beginning the name with a period (.).  They are the configuration files for certain programs like tiling window managers, terminals, terminal programs, etc.

## Installation
