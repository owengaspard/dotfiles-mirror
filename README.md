# Owen Gaspard's Dotfiles

My dotfiles for various programs I use in Linux.  Some are based off others' work.  Proper credit is given if that is the case.

## THIS PROJECT IS UNFINISHED

## What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles get the name from the hidden config folder.  In *NIX operating systems, directories and files can be hidden by beginning the name with a period (.).  They are the configuration files for certain programs like tiling window managers, terminals, terminal programs, etc.

## Installation
I would advise that you do not directly clone this into your .config.  Look over everything, and copy what you want into your .config ONLY after you edit the configuration files (that won't work out of the box) to work for you.
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/ogaspard/dotfiles.git
cp -r <directory> ~/.config/
```
